      <h1>Notes on data gathering</h1>

      <div class="segment-content">
        <p>
          Before publishing, we've cleaned up the data a little bit in order to prevent the <strike>warforged</strike> <strike>tin cans</strike> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8j7pdt/just_remember_folks/" target="_blank">the bit of rock we tricked into thinking</a> from choking on it.
          Examples of data manipulation include, and are mostly limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ages were made into numbers and rounded down where appropriate â€” unless it was apparent the respondee thought they were funny.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some questions were single choice for a reason. If people tried to abuse 'other' in order to list more than one answer, the first entered value was kept and the rest were discarded. Answers that were a variant of 'all' or 'none' were turned into empty cells. The only questions where 'none' answers were kept
            were the "fav soundtrack" questions, because oh boy. There was a pattern.
          </li>
          <li>
            {{surveyResults.deletedCount}} responses were identified as a duplicates, which probably appeared due to glitch in the poll. Duplicates were identified by looking at the questions with free-entry responses.

        <p>
          Just like last year, we started by gathering some demographics data to start things off.
          Last year, demographics data was limited to platform, vague age, and the vague time spent in fandom.
          This year, we've decided to also ask for location and gender.

          So there's that. The "dragons are a stereotypically female interest" redditor got BTFO'd. In the "other" department, there is a few trans-adjacent things (mostly nonbinary). I am pleasantly suprised about the lack of super-special-snowflake genders and a negligible number of apache-genders (apache-genders appearing in this poll: '420'). Thanks for keeping the answer serious.

        <p>
          In last year's poll, the questions regarding movie ratings were rather simplistic: in addition to an overall rating on a scale from 1 to 10, people also got to vote on the best and the worst aspect of each movie.
          This has been a major source of criticism. This year we've decided to just give people the ability to rate each aspect on the rate from 1 to 10. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We've also added some additional comments: most notably, favourite and least favourite character for each movie, as well as another bonus question for the second and third movie.

          Very top-heavy graph, we're getting a nice bell curve approximation across the board. Sometimes, data is beautiful.

          Needless to say, I find 'least favourite' results a little bit surprising, with Gobber getting a #2 (though I guess I can see why

          As usual, we'll be starting by plotting the 1-10 ratings on a graph. We can see that the ratings are getting a lil bit ... degraded.
          It's like our bell curve got shifted to the left and got fatter to boot. Someone put it on a diet.

        <p>
          And the ratings dropped across the board: plot bar now has a strong presence as far down as 7, score bar is down considerably, theme is down ... 
          the visuals got seems to be the only metric that's getting a bump.

          If you wonder about what the 'salt squad' represents on the graph â€” it's the people who answered with any variant of 
          <i>'I actually hate all of them.'</i>like  The reason The Hidden World gets this category while the other movies don't is because
          The Hidden World is the only one that attracted the answers like this.
        </p>
        <p>There's two more things that are worth noting here â€” one: 'Shy' category is twice the size compared to
          the other two movies; and two: you actually can't infer anything from it, since this category contains both people who left the question
          blank, as well as people who provided a non-answer such as <i>"I don't have a favourite"</i> or <i>"I like them all"</i>.

          I initially wasn't going to comment here, but a few trends become a bit ... <i>well</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And by that I mean what the hell is going up with the emotion graph? If you look at the other graphs when comparing The Hidden World with
          the first two movies, you see that when ratings less or equal to 5 start popping up everywhere, higher up ratings usually take the L to
          compensate across the board. This does not happen in the emotion graph: in fact, 10/10 stays at the same level as the first two movies while
          only 7/10-9/10 columns take the L.
        </p>
        <p>
          This raises questions. Why does that happen? Who voted for the 10/10 emotion on The Hidden World? Is this a result of people just blindly giving
          10/10 to everything across the board for the emotion rating? Or are people represented in 10/10 column for HTTYD1 and/or HTTYD2 an entirely
          different group than the ones who 10/10'd The Hidden World? Did the salt squad jump on the 10/10 wagon because "THW surely evoked emotions, just
          not the ones it intended," or is this just a boring anomaly with nothing deeper behind it?
        </p>
        <p>
          There's so many different possibilities, so many hypothesises. We will definitely be digging through that once we're done with presenting
          the raw answers.

      <h1>Favourite things</h1>

      <p>
        This year, we have also asked people for a few favourite things. Let's start with the 'favourite draconid'
        category to start things off. Furthermore, we've decided to ask people to explain their pick and show some
        of the most well-written answers (where the criteria was mostly how specific the reasoning given was).
        The reasons people gave for their answer are sorted per answer.

        The 'favourite villain' question largely follows the same format as the previous one, so I don't feel
        the need to repeat myself. Let's go straight to the results.

        Unlike the previous two, this question came without a 'please explain' field â€” mostly because Tamius 
        didn't forsee anything interesting coming out of it, and thus only annoyed Brussel into adding the 
        'please explain' section to the previous two questions.

        <p>
          If there's one thing everyone can agree about this movie, it's the fact that the movie has been rather controversial in the fandom. This made it "worthy" of additional questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with the Light Fury.

        <p>
          Almost no surprises here. The ratings are about as contested as the rest of the The Hidden World related questions so far.

        <p>
          I really like how both of these got (on average) worse results than the plot rating. Let's plot them on the same graph, just for shits and giggles:

        <p>
          Now I <i>really</i> want to see how the the votes moved around, between plot rating and these two.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last but not least: the themes. Due to limited space below the graphs, the labels were shortened from the original answers.
          Most of the answers are accurate but possibly abbreviated version of what was on poll. The only exception is the answer
          <i>'Negative Effects Humans Sometimes Have on Animals and/or the Environment'</i>: due its excessive length, the graph label
          for it is 'Misantrophy' (which basically means exactly the same thing). 'Putting aside idealism when neccessary' was shortened
          to 'putting aside idealism.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'other' box allowed for free-form entry, which was ... fun, and spawned a few categories of answers. 'All garbage' is
          self-explanatory, 'ðŸ§‚' were salty or sarcastic answers, and 'other' is limited to all answers that don't fit
          in either of the two newly-spawned. Note that 'All garbage' doesn't necessarily imply 'ðŸ§‚'.

          ðŸ§‚ option itself provided a really wide array of answers. To give some examples:

          Last but not least â€” even though Race to the Edge is <b>not</b> canon to the movie franchise as far as cold, hard facts
          are concerned, we will see people insisting that it is from time to time. Which begs the question â€” how many people <i>do</i>
          think that RTTE is canon? Well ...
