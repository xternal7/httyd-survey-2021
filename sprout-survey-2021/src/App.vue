      <h1>Notes on data gathering</h1>

      <div class="segment-content">
        <p>
          Before publishing, we've cleaned up the data a little bit in order to prevent the <strike>warforged</strike> <strike>tin cans</strike> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8j7pdt/just_remember_folks/" target="_blank">the bit of rock we tricked into thinking</a> from choking on it.
          Examples of data manipulation include, and are mostly limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ages were made into numbers and rounded down where appropriate â€” unless it was apparent the respondee thought they were funny.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some questions were single choice for a reason. If people tried to abuse 'other' in order to list more than one answer, the first entered value was kept and the rest were discarded. Answers that were a variant of 'all' or 'none' were turned into empty cells. The only questions where 'none' answers were kept
            were the "fav soundtrack" questions, because oh boy. There was a pattern.
          </li>
          <li>
            {{surveyResults.deletedCount}} responses were identified as a duplicates, which probably appeared due to glitch in the poll. Duplicates were identified by looking at the questions with free-entry responses.
          </li>

        <p>
          Just like last year, we started by gathering some demographics data to start things off.
          Last year, demographics data was limited to platform, vague age, and the vague time spent in fandom.
          This year, we've decided to also ask for location and gender.
        </p>

        <div class="graph-area">

            description="'Snowflake' contains people who think are funny and gave answers like 'example: 11' or anything not a number. Answers like 'I'll be X soon' were corrected to answerer's current age."
            :conf="{trackWidth: '6px !important', columnWidth: '8px !important'}"
            :columns="graphColumnDefinitions[Question.Age]()"

        <p>
          So there's that. The "dragons are a stereotypically female interest" redditor got BTFO'd. In the "other" department, there is a few trans-adjacent things (mostly nonbinary). I am pleasantly suprised about the lack of super-special-snowflake genders and a negligible number of apache-genders (apache-genders appearing in this poll: '420'). Thanks for keeping the answer serious.

      <h1>Scores of scores</h1>
      <div class="segment-content">
        <p>
          In last year's poll, the questions regarding movie ratings were rather simplistic: in addition to an overall rating on a scale from 1 to 10, people also got to vote on the best and the worst aspect of each movie.
          This has been a major source of criticism. This year we've decided to just give people the ability to rate each aspect on the rate from 1 to 10. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We've also added some additional comments: most notably, favourite and least favourite character for each movie, as well as another bonus question for the second and third movie.

          Very top-heavy graph, we're getting a nice bell curve approximation across the board. Sometimes, data is beautiful.
          Let's move on to the next graph: which characters people liked and which characters they hated.
        </p>

        <div class="graph-area">
          <graph
            title="Favourite and least favourite character"

              trackWidthMultiset: '16px !important',

        </div>

        <p>
          Needless to say, I find 'least favourite' results a little bit surprising, with Gobber getting a #2 (though I guess I can see why
          people voted that way).

          As usual, we'll be starting by plotting the 1-10 ratings on a graph. We can see that the ratings are getting a lil bit ... degraded.
          It's like our bell curve got shifted to the left and got fatter to boot. Someone put it on a diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the ratings dropped across the board: plot bar now has a strong presence as far down as 7, score bar is down considerably, theme is down ... 
          the visuals got seems to be the only metric that's getting a bump.

          I initially wasn't going to comment here, but a few trends become a bit ... <i>well</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And by that I mean what the hell is going up with the emotion graph? If you look at the other graphs when comparing The Hidden World with
          the first two movies, you see that when ratings less or equal to 5 start popping up everywhere, higher up ratings usually take the L to
          compensate across the board. This does not happen in the emotion graph: in fact, 10/10 stays at the same level as the first two movies while
          only 7/10-9/10 columns take the L.
        </p>
        <p>
          This raises questions. Why does that happen? Who voted for the 10/10 emotion on The Hidden World? Is this a result of people just blindly giving
          10/10 to everything across the board for the emotion rating? Or are people represented in 10/10 column for HTTYD1 and/or HTTYD2 an entirely
          different group than the ones who 10/10'd The Hidden World? Did the salt squad jump on the 10/10 wagon because "THW surely evoked emotions, just
          not the ones it intended," or is this just a boring anomaly with nothing deeper behind it?

          There's so many different possibilities, so many hypothesises. We will definitely be digging through that once we're done with presenting
          the raw answers.

          Ho boy: initially, this (and the 'favourite villain') question was meant to ship without the "but why" question box. However, it was forseen that this would be a runaway victory for Toothless â€” a rather boring result.
          In order to make the results of this poll less boring, Tam insisted really really hard on adding the "but why is it your favourite" follow-up question, so you can see why people have their favourites.

          If there's one thing everyone can agree about this movie, it's the fact that the movie has been rather controversial in the fandom. This made it "worthy" of additional questions.
