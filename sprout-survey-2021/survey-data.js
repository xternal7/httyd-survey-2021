While Hiccup champions peace between humans and dragons, Grimmel sees dragons as a direct challenge to humanity's place in the world thus causing him to actively hunt down every last Nightfury and also try to simply kill the dragons instead of controlling them like Drago. \n\nThis is because his personality, his entire being, his core, is defined by killing Nightfuries. So when he finds himself in direct ideological (and obviously physical) conflict with Hiccup, he is presented with the notion that he might be wrong. He, as a person, could be wrong. His entire core being, incorrect, his goals and only true motivation for all the horrible and destructive acts he has committed might be wrong, which is what causes him to taunt and belittle everything about Hiccup from their first scene together in Hiccup's house, to their final scene in the skies above New Berk. He feels the need to do this (not only because he's a terrible human being) but because he feels the need to place doubt within Hiccup's mind that perhaps his view of being at peace with dragons is wrong and that the idea of killing dragons and reverting back to old traditions is the correct way of moving forward. Also he looks angry and shocked when he finds out that he hadn't killed all of the Nightfuries which indicates that he feels as if he has failed at fulfilling who he is. \n\nSo in literally every scene they are in together, the two are going at and trying to win on the physical and ideological front. This is what makes their conflict so compelling because they are not only fighting to win in terms of what is physically happening but also to prove which world view is correct. Also, when that final fight scene involving the Light Fury happens, it truly is the climax to their conflict in every sense of the word because it proves that throughout all that hardship, struggle and doubt, Hiccup's world view ultimately does triumph and it shows that loving and caring for dragons truly is the only prevailing view. \n\nThis is just my opinion and it may have not come through totally in what I wrote but I do truly believe this is why Grimmel is the best villain. He may not be as developed in terms of how we can empathize with his actions, nor is he as good of a strategist as Viggo Grimborn (he's in third place for me after Drago who is in second place) but he does directly oppose the worldview of Hiccup and all of Berk which makes him more of a personal antagonist to Hiccup and Toothless.","reasonScore":null},"63":1,"64":0,"66":5,"67":[0,2],"68":[4,2],"72":7},{"1":20,"2":1,"3":6,"4":{"value":1},"5":7,"6":3,"7":[1,2,3,4],"8":9,"9":true,"10":8,"11":7,"12":9,"13":7,"14":7,"15":7,"16":{"value":2},"17":{"value":8},"18":{"value":25},"19":8,"20":8,"21":8,"22":8,"23":7,"24":9,"25":7,"26":{"value":5},"27":{"value":8},"28":{"value":14},"29":7,"30":7,"31":6,"32":7,"33":6,"34":9,"35":7,"36":{"value":2},"37":{"value":16},"38":{"value":19},"39":3,"40":3,"41":7,"42":6,"43":8,"44":6,"45":[1,3,5,6],"49":8,"51":1,"52":8,"53":5,"54":7,"55":3,"56":7,"57":7,"58":6,"59":2,"60":0,"61":{"value":6,"reason":"I'm a sucker for massive, mean-looking monsters.","reasonScore":null},"62":{"value":1,"reason":"I don't really know, I guess just because I understand why he thinks the way he does, green/red death 2nd fav tho","reasonScore":null},"63":1,"64":0,"66":9,"67":[0,2],"68":[1,3],"72":7},{"2":2,"3":4,"4":{"value":7},"5":6,"6":2,"7":[1,3,4,0],"8":10,"9":false,"10":10,"11":10,"12":8,"13":10,"14":10,"15":9,"16":{"value":3},"17":{"value":11},"18":{"value":10},"19":9,"20":8,"21":10,"22":9,"23":8,"24":10,"25":10,"26":{"value":2},"27":{"value":11},"28":{"value":9},"29":10,"30":10,"31":10,"32":9,"33":10,"34":10,"35":10,"36":{"value":3},"37":{"value":11},"38":{"value":15},"39":1,"40":1,"41":9,"42":10,"43":10,"44":10,"45":[3,6],"49":10,"51":0,"59":0,"60":1,"61":{"value":0,"reason":"It's an amazing character design with a great amount of emotion and character","reasonScore":null},"62":{"value":3,"reason":"I love how he mirrors the path hiccup would have went down if he killed toothless in httyd1","reasonScore":null},"63":1,"64":0,"66":1,"67":[2,4],"68":[4]},{"1":25,"2":1,"3":6,"4":{"value":1},"5":7,"6":1,"7":[1,2,3,4],"8":9,"9":true,"10":7,"11":8,"12":9,"13":7,"14":6,"15":9,"16":{"value":2},"17":{"value":10},"18":{"value":7},"19":7,"20":6,"21":8,"22":8,"23":6,"24":7,"25":8,"26":{"value":3},"27":{"value":8},"28":{"value":9},"29":4,"30":2,"31":6,"32":5,"33":3,"34":8,"35":7,"36":{"value":3},"37":{"value":15},"38":{"value":12},"39":1,"40":1,"41":3,"42":4,"43":2,"44":1,"45":[1,3,6],"49":7,"51":1,"52":9,"53":7,"54":7,"55":6,"56":6,"57":6,"58":4,"59":2,"60":0,"61":{"value":0,"reason":"If Toothless is the mean average example of Night Furys as a species they show high levels of intelligence, as well as being just that liitle bit OP compared to other dragons.
